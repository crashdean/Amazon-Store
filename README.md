# Amazon-Store

This app named Bamazon was created to demonstrate the use of mysql database in conjunction with node. The database was created using the schema and seeds files found in this ripository.   Once the amazonDB is created, the app will connect and the user is prompted for a purchase. The app starts by diplaying all of the products for purchase from the mysql database. The purchase is compared to the stock in the database and if the quantity is available, the purchase is successful.   Watch the demo video provided for a quick run through of this app.
